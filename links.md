7. [A Guide to Low Level Programming for Beginners](https://www.coursereport.com/blog/a-guide-to-low-level-programming-for-beginners)<br>
C is a programming language that is considered low level. Low level programming language is where you need to allocate memory manually every time you want to use it. This blog will help you understand low level progamming for beginners.

8. [Dynamic Memory Allocation in C using malloc(), calloc(), free() and realloc()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/)<br>
Being a low level programming language, in C you need to manually allocate every memory that you want to use. If you never use low level programming language or are new to low level programming you might get confused on how to allocate memory dynamically. You can read different memory allocation function that C provide on this site and understand better what each function do.

9. [C - Memory Management](https://youtu.be/734IQSAkww4)<br>
Video tutorial to help you better understand about memory management in C language

10. [Understanding Shared Libraries in Linux](https://www.tecmint.com/understanding-shared-libraries-in-linux/)<br>
In programming, you don't want to rewrite the same code for every program you want to make, sparing you from the unecessary cluttering and bloated program size. With shared library, you can use the method available in the library without rewriting it on your program. You can visit this article for introduction to shared libraries in linux

11. [Paging in Operating Systems with Example & Working - Memory Management](https://youtu.be/pJ6qrCB8pDw)<br>
Paging is a memory management system that is very popular and widely used even to this day. This video explains what paging is with clear explanation and visual.

12. [What is virtual memory? â€“ Gary explains](https://youtu.be/2quKyPnUShQ)<br>
What is a virtual memory? How does it work? I find this video's explanation very useful and you might too!

13. [Memory Swapping](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30467/memory-swapping)<br>
Memory swapping is a memory reclamation method wherein memory contents not currently in use are swapped to a disk to make the memory available for other applications or processes. This is very useful if you have no memory left for program to run. You can visit this link and understand more about memory swap

14. [Thrashing in Operating System](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/thrashing-in-operating-system)<br>
Thrashing is a condition where the system spend more time in paging rather than actual productive processing. This is something you want to avoid. Familiarize yourself with thrashing and its technique to handle this problem.

15. [Demand Paging Notes](http://lass.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/courses/fall13/lectures/Lec14_notes.pdf)<br>
Demand paging is a technique whereby pages are loaded only when they are demanded during program execution. This is commonly used in virtual memory systems. A demand-paging system is similar to a paging system with swapping Demand paging explains one of the primary benefits of virtual memory, by loading only the portions of programs that are needed, memory is used more efficiently. This notes explain very clearly about demand paging.

16. [Process Management (Processes and Threads)](https://youtu.be/OrM7nZcxXZU)<br>
A short video explaining processes and threads.

17. [Atomic Operation](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3466/atomic-operation#:~:text=Explains%20Atomic%20Operation-,What%20Does%20Atomic%20Operation%20Mean%3F,systems%20and%20parallel%20processing%20systems.)<br>
Atomic?! thats sounds so cool! but what is atomic operation in operating system? This article can help you understand it.

18. [Semaphores in Operating System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/semaphores-in-operating-system)<br>
In computer science, a semaphore is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes and avoid critical section problems in a concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system. This article explain more of what it is, the advantage of using it, and the disadvantage of using it.

19. [Deadlock](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/)<br>

20. [Shared Memory](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/inter_process_communication/inter_process_communication_shared_memory.htm)<br>
In Computer Science, shared memory is memory that may be simultaneously accessed by multiple programs with an intent to provide communication among them or avoid redundant copies. Shared memory is an efficient means of passing data between programs. Depending on context, programs may run on a single processor or on multiple separate processors. Visit this article to understand more about it.

21. [Race Condition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/dotnet/visual-basic/race-conditions-deadlocks)<br>
A situation where several processes access and manipulate the same data concurrently and the outcome of the execution depends on the particular order in which the access takes place, is called a race condition. This Microsoft documentation explains more about race condition and deadlock.
